## bitNouns

First there was **NounsDAO.**

Then there was **Lil Nouns.**

Next came **bitNouns.**

An expansion DAO based on Lil Nouns DAO, bitNouns works to create another layer within the Nounish ecosystem; The teeniest tiniest layer yet.

By expanding the ecosystem, bitNouns aims at exposing more people to Lil Nouns DAO, and in turn Nouns DAO and the entire Nounish ecosystem via a **practically free** way to participate.

Although bitNouns have been set up with an auction, the reserve is set for the lowest possible fee + gas fees while using Nouns.Build to:

- Give new web3 participants a low barier of entry into NFTs.
- Give people a chance to enter into the Nouns Ecosystem and experience Nounish governance for as low cost as possible. 

bitNoun auctions begin on April 1st 2023 with a .0001 eth reserve + Gas fees.

Each bitNoun will represent 1 vote on Lil Nouns DAO Proposals through bitNoun delegations **only.**

bitNouns will start with 1 Lil Nouns delegated from the bitNounders and creators of www.Nouns101.wtf.

bitNouns will also accept delegation of Lil Nouns and NounsDAO tokens to further experiment with a nearly-free governance model in the Nouns Ecossystem.

**Disclaimer: bitNouns is an experiment and intended for educational purposes only.**
