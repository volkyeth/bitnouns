title: 5 Minute Auction
order: 1
---
The bitNouns Auction Contract will act as a self-sufficient Lil Noun generation and distribution mechanism, auctioning one Lil Noun every 5 minutes, forever. 100% of auction proceeds (ETH) are automatically deposited in the bitNouns DAO treasury, where they are governed by bitNoun owners.
Each time an auction is settled, the settlement transaction will also cause a new bitNoun to be minted and a new 5 minute auction to begin.
While settlement is most heavily incentivized for the winning bidder, it can be triggered by anyone, allowing the system to trustlessly auction bitNouns as long as Ethereum is operational and there are interested bidders.
